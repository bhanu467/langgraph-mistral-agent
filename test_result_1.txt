Output: [MATH] Math Solution:
 To solve this problem, we follow the order of operations, which is commonly remembered by the acronym PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

Step 1: Multiply the numbers being multiplied, which are 15 and 2. That gives us 30.

Step 2: Add the number that was not involved in the multiplication, which is 10.

So, 10 + (15 * 2) = 10 + 30 = 40

The final answer is 40.
